                I support the network infrastructure of Amazon sites across the
                Midwestern United States. I monitor network status and maintain
                the health of all network devices, including Cisco and
                commodity, for all sites in the region. I lead and execute
                large-scale projects with site-wide impact and partner with
                vendors, business partners, and internal teams to coordinate the
                replacement of network devices, perform infrastructure
                maintenance, and implement new kinds of technology as they
                become available. I triage the ticket queue daily, prioritizing
                based on a severity level system, and provide direct customer
                support for Windows 10, end-user equipment (such as scanners,
                printers, thin clients, etc), as well as internal tools and
                software. I also work on an on-call rotation.
